        <p>
        Bookcase Database is a simple web application that allows users to 
        create a virtual bookcase to store information about books they have. 
        Users can add books to their bookcase manually or search for books
        using the Google Books API, edit the information about the
        books, and delete books from their bookcase.

        As it currently stands, bc.db does not bring anything new to the
        table, but stay tuned for exciting new features in the near future.
