# Bookcase Database - CS50x Final Project

![](design/bcdb-logo-h-sm.png)

## What is Bookcase Database?
Bookcase Database is a simple web application that allows you to 
create virtual bookcases to store information about your books. 
You can add books to your bookcases manually or search for books
using the Google Books API. You can also edit the information about the
books, including ratings and notes.

## What did I learn while working on this project?

### Preface
Well, quite a lot. Coming into this project, I was about three months into
my journey learning to code. I had completed the CS50x course, except for the
final project. I had a bunch of ideas for final projects, but I didn't know
how to implement actually implement them. I decided to take the CS50 Python
and CS50 SQL courses to expand on the knowledge I gained from CS50x. While working
through the courses that CS50 offers, I was also completing the Odin Project
Foundations course. I completed Foundations right before I started working on 
Bookcase Database.

My initial idea for Bookcase Database was to create a web application where
users could upload an image of a bookshelf in real life and my app would 
analyze the image and create a virtual bookcase, automatically adding all of
the books from the photograph. I quickly realized that this was way beyond my
current skill level. I decided to scale back my idea and create a simple web
application that would allow users to create virtual bookcases and add books.
Stepping into the world of AI and machine learning is something I would like to
do in the near future. So, I intend to revisit my original idea, updating this
app or creating a new one in the near future.

### My Process
I started by jotting down a list of the features I wanted to include in my
app. I'm a very visual person, so I also created a few mockups of what I
wanted the app to look like. I then created a Trello board to keep track of


I learned a lot about how to use Flask and SQL to create a web application.
I also learned how to use the Google Books API to search for books and
retrieve information about them. I also learned how to use the Jinja
templating language to create dynamic web pages. I also learned how to
use the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive web application. I
also learned how to use the `requests` module to make HTTP requests to
the Google Books API. I also learned how to use the `json` module to 
parse JSON data. I also learned how to use the `datetime` module to 
format dates and times. I also learned how to use the `re` module to 
validate user input. I also learned how to use the `os` module to 
access environment variables. I also learned how to use the `flask`
module to create a web application. I also learned how to use the `sql`
module to interact with a SQLite database. I also learned how to use
the `werkzeug.security` module to hash passwords. I also learned how
to use the `flask_login` module to manage user sessions. I also learned
how to use the `flask_wtf` module to create forms. I also learned how
to use the `wtforms` module to create forms. I also learned how to use
the `flask_bootstrap` module to use the Bootstrap framework in a Flask
application. I also learned how to use the `flask_sqlalchemy` module
to use SQLAlchemy in a Flask application. I also learned how to use
the `flask_migrate` module to use Flask-Migrate in a Flask application.
I also learned how to use the `flask_script` module to use Flask-Script

I learned how to create a virtual environment using `venv`. I learned
how to install packages using `pip`. I learned how to use `git` to
